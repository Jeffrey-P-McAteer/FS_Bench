# FS_Bench

FS_Bench measures how closely your application-level filesystem performance is to hardware performance.

Many things can degrade the performance of an operating system, none so fatal as accidentially configuring a bad filesystem.

# Building

For Windows:

```bash
.\build.bat
```

For Linux + Mac

```bash
./build.sh
```


# Running

```bash

```

# Measured numbers from hardware configurations
